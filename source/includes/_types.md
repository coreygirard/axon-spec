# Types

- The printed representation of any Axon value is valid JSON
- The `print` statement pretty-prints by default

## Null

```c
null
```

A value representing the absence of a value. Frequently used in error handling

## Booleans

```python
true
false
```

Just what it sounds like

## Integers

```python
4
52
1_000_000
assert 5 / 2 == 2.5
```

No weird Python 2 integer arithmetic here

## Floats

```python
4.0
0.25
```

## Strings

```
"some string"
'this "is" a string'
```

Double-quoted strings are preferred, but single-quoted strings are chosen if they reduce the required escaping

## Lists

## Maps
